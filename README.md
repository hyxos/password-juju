# password-juju

Just a little CLI random password generator.

# Why?

Because sometimes you need a random password and you don't want to think about it that much.

# Implementation

Just a minimal CLI wrapper over the `node` `crypto` library.

## Usage

```bash
# Put your own secret in the .env file! Shhh... ðŸ¤«
$ echo "SECRET=This can be whatever you want" > .env
```

```bash
# Just give me a random password!
$ password
> p3eneRZgoesyhZgOLqsSX5VyM9lpWd
# Add a seed to make it deterministic
$ password bucky
> 8vRPrJZoowi2yuOZOsY69fc+q/MSgW
```

The cool part about generating passwords with a secret and a seed, is that they are deterministic, meaning if you know the seed and the secret you can use a simple phrase to generate the password again if you forget it.

```bash
# New facebook password
echo "SECRET=My little secret" > .env
password "Zuck no more"
> LHFjqWwLHRmPEWAy/LgVNOU1gGMVTj
password "Zuck no more"
> LHFjqWwLHRmPEWAy/LgVNOU1gGMVTj
```

Get fancy...
```bash
$ password -l

### TODO

- Maybe we'll turn this into a nice little npm package.
- Check for .env file first when it runs and ask for a secret if it doesn't have one
- Add arguments table
